&emsp; Throughout the past academic year, I played a pivotal role in our Senior Design project, focusing on the
development of the project's API using .NET and Entity Framework, crafting client-side web pages with Angular
Framework, conducting thorough testing and debugging, and actively participating in brainstorming sessions and
meetings. My responsibilities on the front end encompassed creating essential components such as the home page,
profile page, task bar, notifications, add-task feature, as well as implementing various design enhancements using
CSS to ensure optimal responsiveness across different screen sizes. Additionally, I took the initiative to produce
graphic designs that not only filled empty screens but also enhanced the overall user experience of the website.

&emsp; These contributions significantly bolstered my skills and expertise as a software engineer. Prior to this
project, I lacked experience in building APIs and utilizing Azure for data management. Delving into front-end
development sharpened my proficiency in TypeScript and honed my abilities in leveraging the Angular Framework,
skills that are invaluable as I prepare to transition back into my full-time role in the coming months. Furthermore,
mastering the intricacies of CSS for creating responsive web applications represented a considerable milestone in
my career progression, one that I overcame with determination and perseverance, ultimately ensuring that our
webpages were optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.
