### Topic Area: ### 
Our goal is to create a web application using our team member's shared experiences in full-stack development. We are aiming to create a productivity tool that users can use to keep track of tasks and enhance how productive they are throughout their day. We want to make it fun and rewarding and are brainstorming ways to "gamify" the experience for users.
