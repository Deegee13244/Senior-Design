### Abstract: ###
Introducing Task Hero: Your ultimate productivity sidekick! Conquer tasks with flair--add, edit, and delete tasks with ease. Unleash your social side by finding and following friends, and climb the leaderboard by competing against your friends and users around the globe. Plus, level up your productivity journey with a dynamic progress bar and unlock exciting rewards and achievements along the way! 

### Topic Area: ### 
Our goal was to create a web application using our team member's shared experiences in full-stack development. We aimed to create a productivity tool that users can use to keep track of tasks and enhance how productive they are throughout their day. We wanted to make it fun and rewarding, and implemented ways to "gamify" the experience for users.
