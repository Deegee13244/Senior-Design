&emsp; In our senior design project, I took part in developing all three components of our web application: UI/UX design using Angular, backend API development with .NET, and database development on a Microsoft Azure SQL database. Throughout this process, I applied my skills in frontend and backend development, crafting a user-friendly interface and reliable API endpoints. Leveraging technologies like Angular, C#, and Azure SQL Database, I ensured seamless integration and efficient data management, showcasing my proficiency in both technical and cloud computing domains, as I configured each component of the application to integrate with each other through Azure's many cloud-based software tools.

&emsp; Despite facing challenges such as debugging issues, configuration issues concerning our cloud architecture, and the task of creating responsive desktop and mobile designs, I successfully delivered a fully functional application hosted on Microsoft Azure. Collaborating with my team, I honed my problem-solving abilities, communication skills, and software development skills, contributing to our collective success in meeting project objectives. This experience not only reinforced my technical competencies but also emphasized the importance of teamwork and effective project management in achieving our goals.

&emsp; Throughout our senior design project, our group accomplished the development and deployment of a robust web application, ready to be used by a large user-base. This achievement highlighted our collective ability to collaborate effectively, leveraging each member's expertise to deliver a comprehensive solution. Through regular communication and division of tasks, we managed to stay on track with project milestones and overcome technical hurdles together.

&emsp; In terms of teamwork, our group excelled in areas such as communication, task delegation, and mutual support. Regular meetings and clear communication channels facilitated efficient collaboration, while assigning tasks based on individual strengths ensured a balanced workload distribution. However, there were instances where coordination could have been improved, leading to minor delays in certain deliverables. We also should've started on the development sooner, as we were pushing the deadline with our work. Reflecting on our efforts, each team member contributed significantly, with complementary skills and dedication driving the project forward.
