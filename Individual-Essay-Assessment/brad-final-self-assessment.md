&emsp; In our senior design project, I took part in developing all three components of our web application: UI/UX design using Angular, backend API development with .NET, and database development on a Microsoft Azure SQL database. Throughout this process, I applied my skills in frontend and backend development, crafting a user-friendly interface and reliable API endpoints. Leveraging technologies like Angular, C#, and Azure SQL Database, I ensured seamless integration and efficient data management, showcasing my proficiency in both technical and cloud computing domains, as I configured each component of the application to integrate with each other through Azure's many cloud-based software tools.

&emsp; Despite facing challenges such as debugging issues, configuration issues concerning our cloud architecture, and the task of creating responsive desktop and mobile designs, I successfully delivered a fully functional application hosted on Microsoft Azure. Collaborating with my team, I honed my problem-solving abilities, communication skills, and software development skills, contributing to our collective success in meeting project objectives. This experience not only reinforced my technical competencies but also emphasized the importance of teamwork and effective project management in achieving our goals.
